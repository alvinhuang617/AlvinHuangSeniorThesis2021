This README contains info on what each file in this repository does, in alphabetical order. The senior thesis can be found in the repo.

Adjacent Amino Acids Revised generates the dipeptide abundance plot seen in Figure 4.

Drosophila Proteome Kappa generates the kappa violin plots seen in Figure 5B.

Drosophila Proteome Content Controlled Violin Plots makes violin plots including proteins with composition similar to that of the DmCdt1 IDR. Not actually used in the thesis.

Drosophila Proteome pI Histogram makes the pI histograms seen in Figure 5A.

Drosophila Split Distances Violin Plots makes the average distance and number of dipeptide violin plots seen in Figure 5D and 5E.

IDR Cdk Sites makes the Cdk site scatter plot seen in Figure 3A.

IDR Kappa Values makes the kappa value violin plot seen in Figure 3C.

IDR Properties generates a variety of plots, but the code of interest denerates the pI histogram from Figure 3B and the amino acid composition violin plots seen in Figure 3D.

IDR Split Distances Violin Plots creates the average distance and number of dipeptides violin plots seen in Figure 3E and 3F.

Random Protein Selection 2 - Amino Acid Percentages All Graphs Combined creates the random selection amino acid composition strip plot seen in Figure 5C.
